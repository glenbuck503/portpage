              <p class="aboutme"><strong>I am 32 years old. I was born and raised here in Portland,OR. Though I do not have a background in coding, in the last 1-2 years I have gained a intrest in learning more about it. I tend to like challenges and with coding being one of the most challenging things I have done and seen, I find it motivating me more and more. I finally decided to pull the trigger and sign myself up for school for coding and after the first week, though my brain hurts, I am very excited.</strong></p>

                <ul>
                  <li><h3><span class="span">Billiards</h3></li>
                  <p>I have been playing pool for over 6 years now competitively now. I started off with 8 ball and then went to 9 ball. I love both games but I am stronger in 9 ball. This is my favorite hobby.</p>
                  <li><h3><span class="span">Snowboarding</h3></li>
                  <p>I have been snowboarding for over 15 years. As I have gotten older, I have found that I dont like getting hurt, which has cuased me to slow myself down when riding. I still can cruise pretty good though!</p>
